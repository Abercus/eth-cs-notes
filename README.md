# ETH Computer Science Notes

These are a portion of the notes I kept for the lectures in my Master's in ETH Zurich. They are mostly based on the primary sources (i.e. lecture slides, tutorials, recordings, exercises), but there are occasional parts borrowed from referenced or unreferenced sources (a simple web search would possibly find the source).

Notes are by no means intended to be complete or comprehensive. If you see some gaps or omitted details it is possibly because either I find the topic very general or I did not really understand it at all. Me being lazy to format it could be another possible reason. That said, I welcome any suggestions on additional content.

Similarly, there could be mistakes in the notes either because I copied and pasted parts from various sources or that I misunderstood the content. Please send me a pull request or an e-mail if I have a typo or any kind of misinformation in the notes.
